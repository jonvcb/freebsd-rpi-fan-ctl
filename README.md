# rpi-fan-ctl
## Raspberry Pi PWM Fan Control Program

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Version History: 
  
2002.09.02 - Version 1.0 - Initial version

### Description: 

I made this simple tool in C to control the speed of the CPU fan of my 
raspbery pi model 4. It should run on other models as well providing they 
have the GPIO interfaces. Made / tested on FreeBSD 13.1 but will likely 
compile on previous versions.  

### Build: 

Just type "make"

Or use #cc rpi-fan-ctl.c -lgpio -o rpi-fan-ctl
